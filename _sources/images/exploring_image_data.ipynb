    "# Exploring Image data\n",
    "Image data in neurobiology can be broadly divided into two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Static images**, including histology, gene expression maps, and other 2 and 3-d images. These represent data at a single time point.\n",
    "- **Dynamic images**, including calcium and fMRI imaging. These represent data as a sequence of images, with a collection of images at each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loading the data\n",
    "This week's data are available for download <a href=\"{{ site.dataurl }}/week3/DirectionTuning_V1_dec.mat\">here</a> (right click and \"save as\"), or can be downloaded from Google Drive via\n",

    "on Colab or in the notebook. The data are recordings of calcium imaging experiments in mouse V1 that come to us courtesy of Ashley Wilson in Lindsey Glickfeld's lab. The data are once again in `.mat` format. This week, they are large by the standards of what we've been working with (~200MB), though far smaller than such datasets are for real experiments. In the actual experiments, images are taken at 30 Hz (30 images per second), whereas the sample data are downsampled to 3 Hz.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the experiment that generated these data, the mice were exposed to a series of drifting grating stimuli, and recorded responses were images reflecting calcium fluorescence levels. The stimuli consisted of drifting gratings at a variety of orientations, probing the sensitivity of cells in V1 to both orientation and motion direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variables in the data file are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `data`: This week, it will be up to you to determine what dimensions correspond to what variables.\n",
    "- `dirTuningExp`: A structure containing metadata about the experiment. In particular:\n",

    "    - `stimOffFrames`: Number of frames during which no stimulus was presented.\n",
    "    - `stimOnFrames`: Number of frames during which each stimulus was presented.\n",
    "    - `tGratingDirectionDeg`: Direction of drift of the moving grating on each trial.\n",
