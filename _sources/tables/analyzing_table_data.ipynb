This time, you _will not_ need to add the cumulative reward or cumulative trial variables. Instead, our goal will be to create a data frame that will allow us to model how total rewards earned vary across sexes as a function of behavioral state. These behavioral states are not observed but determined by using a [Hidden Markov Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model) (not as difficult as Wikipedia makes it look) to model behavior. That's a bit much for us to bite off at this point, but thanfully, the authors have already assigned each trial to either:\n",

    "## Statistical modeling\n",
    "Of course, eyeballing our plots will only get us so far. Eventually, we will want to produce some kind of statistical model that helps us determine whether the results we see could be due to chance. Note that I'm speaking in terms of statistical _modeling_ because rather than just trying to run a test, we want to think in terms of what kind of process might have generated the data and build in our assumptions about that. Even very simple statistical tests are built on models that encapsulate our assumptions. For example, [every ANOVA is just a linear model](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/175246/why-is-anova-equivalent-to-linear-regression), and the class of linear models (and their cousins) are much more flexible and powerful.\n",

    "## Mixed effects modeling\n",
    "Of course, something about the above models stinks. If you've done any amount of regression, you know that standard linear models assume that the errors are independent and identically distributed. This means that once we specify the sex of the animal and its behavioral state, all the deviations of the data from the model's prediction are drawn from the same normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this obviously ignores two extremely important sources of variation in the real data&mdash;subject and session&mdash;and as we showed above, these sources of variation are _not_ negligible. One (bad) attempt at solving this problem is to simply do a separate regression for each animal (and perhaps each session), but in that case, we have very few data points to go on. Another (also bad) solution is to try fitting separate parameters for, e.g., each session's mean rewards, but that drastically increases the number of parameters we have to fit. Instead we'll assume the following:\n",
    "1. We start by using state and sex to make a (linear) prediction for the total reward obtained. These are called our _fixed effects_. \n",
    "1. But we assume that every subject's individual prediction is jittered around this value. Some subjects, even accounting for state and sex, earn a little more or a little less. \n",
    "1. In addition, we assume that every session is distributed around the subject's mean performance. Again, some are a little better, some a little worse.\n",
    "\n",
    "These latter two additions are called _random effects_, and models that include both fixed and random effects are known as _mixed effects models_. In math form, this is\n",
