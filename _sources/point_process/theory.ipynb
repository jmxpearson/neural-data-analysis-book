    "At its most basic, a point process is a statistical distribution whose samples are _collections of points_. This is somewhat more abstract than distribution that\n",

    "In this chapter, we will concentrate exclusively on a single kind of very special point process: the Poisson process. This is partly because the Poisson process\n",

    "will assume we know a single positive parameter $\\lambda > 0$ called the _intensity_ or _rate_ of the process. We will also assume (for the moment) that this \n",

In fact, we can derive an expression for this using a key fact about Poisson processes: for disjoint intervals (periods of time that don't overlap), the numbers of events in each are _independent_. As a result, we can consider breaking an interval of size $T$ into very small intervals $\\Delta t$ such that $T = N \\Delta t$. We can then calculate the probability that there are no events for a time $T$:\n",
