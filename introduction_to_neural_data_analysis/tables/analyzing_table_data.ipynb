    "To begin follow the same approach as [last time](exploring-table-data) to download the data, load it, and combine it. This time, you _will not_ need to add the cumulative reward or cumulative trial variables. Instead, our goal will be to create a data frame that will allow us to model how total rewards earned vary across sexes as a function of behavioral state. These behavioral states are not observed but determined by using a [Hidden Markov Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model) (not as difficult as Wikipedia makes it look) to model behavior. That's a bit much for us to bite off at this point, but thanfully, the authors have already assigned each trial to either:\n",
