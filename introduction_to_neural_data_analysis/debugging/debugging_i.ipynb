    "# Debugging Practicum I\n",
    "In this class, we'll use all the tools at our disposal to fix some code that isn't working. <a href=\"{{ site.dataurl }}/week4/pupil.mat\">The data</a> for this exercise are time series of pupil measurements taken while a participant completed an [\"oddball\" task](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oddball_paradigm), and the analysis performed is plotting trial-averaged pupil responses to standard and deviant sounds, locked to stimulus presentation. As with most code in the wild, this is only lightly commented. This constitutes what is often called a [minimal working example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_Working_Example) (MWE), apart from the fact that it's not quite minimal and not quite working.\n",

    "The complete code, put together as a Jupyter notebook, is available [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1n8rwZZOX7gaHQ33XlH5EEVR5E6VAfVkP?usp=sharing), but is also listed below. Your goal in class, using whatever means you have at your disposal, is to find and remove the bugs.\n",
