    "- The smaller the bins, the fewer events in each bin. As a result, smaller bins lead to less (visually) apparent increases in firing.\n",
    "- Smaller bins result in \"spikier\" estimates of firing rate during the 1 s period of elevated firing. This is true despite the fact that we know that the firing rate during this period is _constant_. Conversely, larger bin sizes lead to _relatively_ less variance in bin counts. (The absolute variance is higher, since the Poisson distribution has a variance that scales as its mean.)\n",
    "- If we were concerned with estimating the onset and offset times of the elevated firing rate, larger bins would make this harder to estimate, since we would only be able to localize this event to within a time comparable to the bin size. That is, as we'll more clearly below, larger bins act as _smoothers_ of firing rate estimates.\n",

Here, we know that firing rates in the middle 1 s period are constant, but if they were changing, smaller bins would allow us to better track those small changes. But the (relative) variance of those estimates would be much higher than if we used larger bins."

    "{numref}`filter-illustration` illustrates this smoothing strategy on a simple example data set of four spikes. In each case, we have replaced a single spike with the filter itself (equivalent to a [convolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution) operation). This operation spreads the influence of the single spike in time, increasing firing rate estimates nearby while lowering them at the time of the spike itself. Note also that, except for the case of the exponential filter, this smoothing spreads firing rate estimates into the future, which means that estimated firing rates will increase _before_ the first spikes actually arrive. Thus, for cases in which latencies and onsets are important, causal filters (which only spread into the past) should always be used."

For example, many experiments generate time stamps of short behaviors that can be viewed as realizations of a point process, and we are often interested in the (average) rate of such a process around sets of other events. In such cases, the PSTH is often the method of choice. Along different lines, for continuously recorded data, we may also be interested in the average time trace of the data across repetitions of the same experimental condition, again aligned to select moments in time (e.g., trial start, movement or stimulus onset, reward delivery). In this case, the PSTH is also a useful analysis (without the hassle of binning). Implicitly, the PSTH assumes that the data have a characteristic time course of interest, and this pattern repeats around some class of events whose locations we know in time. Aligning the data to these events and then averaging thus produces an estimate of this \"typical\" time course."
