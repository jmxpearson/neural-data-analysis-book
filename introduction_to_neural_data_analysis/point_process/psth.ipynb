    "\n",
    "The peri-stimulus (or peri-event) time histogram (PSTH/PETH) is one of the most prevalent analyses in systems neuroscience. Its original usage was in identifying responses of single neurons to specific events in time (where the events were action potentials), but it can also be used to analyze time series of specific behaviors, estimate connected cell pairs, and analyze any number of other ways in which streams of events might relate to other events in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we're going to work through the process of creating a simple PSTH using Python, noting along the way how various parameter choices capture relevant statistical assumptions and tradeoffs as well as affecting the look and feel of the resulting plots.\n",
