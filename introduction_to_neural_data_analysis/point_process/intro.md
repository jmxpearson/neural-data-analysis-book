# Point process data
Point process data, usually in the form of spike times from recorded neurons, are one of the most common data types in systems neuroscience. In this
chapter, we'll look at some theory of point processes &mdash; including why they're called that &mdash; learn how to estimate their underlying event 
rates, and take a look at some common data analysis methods, including the ubiquitous peri-stimulus time histogram (PSTH).
