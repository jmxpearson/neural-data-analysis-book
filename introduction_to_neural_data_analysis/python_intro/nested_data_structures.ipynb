    "So what's this good for? Here, we are mostly exploring the way the Allen Brain Atlas is organized. But more generally, we've seen how to download data from the web, turn it into a hierarchical JSON data structure, and explore its contents. That can be useful when we need to, for instance, pull information from one or several online web pages or databases, loop over the results, and extract key pieces of information. Even more impressive, this has only take a few lines of code. The most time-consuming part in this (and most) cases came down to figuring out how to navigate nested lists and dictionaries to find where the information we needed was stored."
